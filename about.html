     <dd> Optical Storage</dd>
     <dt> Optical Technology</dt>
<p>There are basically two types of disk storage for computers: magnetic and optical. In magnetic storage,
data is recorded magnetically on rotating disks. Optical disc storage is similar to magnetic disk
storage in basic operation, but it reads and writes using light (optically) instead of magnetism.
Although most magnetic disk storage is fully read and write capable many times over, many optical
storage media are either read-only or write-once. Note the convention in which we refer to magnetic
as disk and optical as disc. This is not a law or rule but is followed by most in the industry.
At one time, it was thought that optical storage would replace magnetic as the primary online storage
medium. However, optical storage has proven to be much slower and far less dense than magnetic
storage and is much more adaptable to removable-media designs. As such, optical storage is
more often used for backup or archival storage purposes and as a mechanism by which programs or
data can be loaded onto magnetic drives. Magnetic storage, being significantly faster and capable of
holding much more information than optical media in the same amount of space, is more suited
for direct online storage and most likely won’t be replaced in that role by optical storage anytime
    soon.</p>
     <p>Optical technology standards for computers can be divided into three major types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>■ CD (compact disc)</li>
    <li>■ DVD (digital versatile disc)</li>
    <li>■ BD (Blu-ray disc)</li>
     </ul>
<p>All of these are descended from popular music and video entertainment standards; CD-based
devices can also play music CDs, and DVD and BD-based devices can play the same video discs you
can purchase or rent. However, computer drives that can use these types of media also offer many
additional features.</p>
<p>In the following sections, you will learn how optical drives and media are similar, how they differ
from each other, and how they can be used to enhance your storage and playback options.</p>
